# Project

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive tracking system to monitor everyone present at the university, including both newly registered students and active faculty members. The Java code we developed allows for the registration of all participants, enabling us to efficiently count and manage both students and teaching staff. Additionally, the system displays a complete list of current instructors along with the subjects they teach. This projectâ€™s core functionality centers around accurate registration, real-time data on university population.
